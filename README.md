# Credit-Risk-Assessment-for-Loan-Approval
This code is purely in Python
Basic example of how AI/ML can be used for credit risk assessment in the context of loan approval. The solution includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python. The example employs a supervised learning approach using the popular Scikit-learn library.
Extensions
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimal parameter tuning.
Explainable AI (XAI): Use libraries like SHAP or LIME to interpret the model's decisions.
Alternative Models: Experiment with Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) or Neural Networks for better performance.
Deployment: Export the trained model using joblib or pickle for integration into production systems.
This foundational code provides a starting point for implementing an AI/ML-based credit risk assessment system in the loan approval process. The choice of algorithms and preprocessing steps can be adapted based on data characteristics and business requirements.
